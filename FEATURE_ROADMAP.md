## 📝 **API Endpoints Needed**

- 🔲 `PUT /api/EnhancedHabit/{id}` - Update habit
- 🔲 `DELETE /api/EnhancedHabit/{id}` - Delete habit
- 🔲 `GET /api/EnhancedHabit/entries?date={date}` - Get daily entries
- 🔲 `POST /api/EnhancedHabit/entries` - Create entry
- 🔲 `PUT /api/EnhancedHabit/entries/{id}` - Update entry

## 🔧 **Technical Debt to Address**

1. **Server Database Initialization:**
   - Currently returns 400 because Habits table doesn't exist
   - Need to run migrations or initialize database

2. **API Endpoint Consistency:**
   - Some endpoints use `/HabitApi`, some use `/EnhancedHabit`
   - Standardize on one controller

3. **Type Definitions:**
   - Ensure React types match C# models exactly
   - Add validation

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Better error messages
   - Retry logic for sync
   - User-friendly error UI

5. **Performance:**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add pagination for large datasets
   - Lazy loading for images

---

## ✅ **Next Action Items**

1. **Start with Habits CRUD** (highest priority)
   - Build form UI
   - Connect to offline database
   - Add API integration (when server ready)

2. **Update API endpoints** on server
   - Add missing CRUD endpoints
   - Initialize database with proper schema

3. **Build Statistics view**
   - Add charts library
   - Calculate metrics from data
