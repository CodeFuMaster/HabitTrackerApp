## Grease‑the‑Groove (GtG) — 5–10 Micro‑Sets / Day

Keep each bout **easy** (RPE 5–6/10). Avoid fatigue; never go to failure.

- **Dead Hangs** (mixed grips): 10–45s × 5–10/day
- **Scapular Pull‑ups**: 3–5 slow reps × 5–8/day
- **Pull‑up Ladders (optional)**: 1‑2‑3 reps; rest 60–90s; stop well short of failure
- **Jump Rope**: 45–90s bursts × 3–5/day (if shins/tendons good)
- **Band Pull‑Apart**: 10–20 reps × 3–6/day
- **Hip/Ankle Snack**: 30–60s couch/ankle stretch a few times/day
- **Grip Extensors**: rubber‑band finger opens 20–30 reps × 2–3/day

> **Weekly Pull‑up Volume Target:** 30–60 quality reps total across GtG + Gym A.

---

## Evening Training

### Martial Arts Nights
- **BJJ (Mon, Wed)**: Aim 60–90 min. Pre‑hab: 1–2 sets scapular pulls + 20–30s dead hang. Post: 3–5 min breath downregulation + gentle hip/neck mobility.
- **Wing Chun (Fri)**: Technique focus + light shoulder pre‑hab as above.

### Gym Nights (Tue, Thu, Sat)
Keep main lifts at ~**RPE 7** (2–3 reps in reserve). If the morning RushFit was brutal, drop one assistance lift.

#### **Gym A — Pull / Hinge / Grip (Tuesday, 45–60 min)**
1) **Main Hinge** *(prioritize this every week)*: **Trap‑bar Deadlift** — **5×3 @ RPE ~7**  
   *If low‑back or recovery is compromised, swap to **RDL 4×5 @ RPE 6–7***
2) **Vertical Pull**: Pull‑ups/Chin‑ups (band‑assist ok) — **4–5×submax** (2–3 RIR)
3) **Horizontal Row**: Chest‑supported row *or* 1‑arm DB row — **3–4×8–12**
4) **Scap/Cuff Superset**: Face pulls **3×15–20** + Cable/Band ER **3×12–15**
5) **Carries**: Heavy farmer carry **3×30–45 m** (2–3 min rest)
6) **Grip Tri‑set** ×2 rounds:  
   Crush grippers **1–2 easy AMRAPs** → Plate pinch **2×30–45s** → Band opens **20–30**
7) **Core (Anti‑extension)**: Ab‑wheel **3×6–10** *(or dead‑bug)*

#### **Gym B — Squat / Push / Scapula / Core (Thursday, 45–60 min)**
1) **Squat — choose ONE pattern** (back **or** front **or** goblet):
   - If AM RushFit was light on squats/lunges: **Back/Front** **4×5–6 @ RPE ~7**
   - If AM had lots of squats/lunges: **Front/Goblet tempo 3‑0‑3** **3×6–8** *or* **2‑sec pause** at bottom
   - If knees/low‑back are cranky: **Bulgarian Split Squat** **3×8–10/side** *(skip axial barbell this session)*
   *Cap heavy axial squats at **1×/week**.*
2) **Press**: Overhead Press *or* Bench — **4×5–8 @ RPE ~7**
3) **Secondary Push**: Dips *or* Incline push‑ups — **3×submax (1–2 RIR)**
4) **Unilateral Squat**: Bulgarian split squat — **3×8–10/side** *(skip if already chosen as the main squat pattern above)*
5) **Calves**: Standing or seated — **3×12–15**
6) **Scapular Pull‑ups** — **3×8–12 (controlled)**
7) **Core (Anti‑rotation)**: Pallof press — **3×10–12/side**
8) **Neck (light, optional)**: band/harness isometrics **2×20–30s** each direction

#### **Gym C — Posterior Chain & Carries (Saturday, 35–50 min, lightest — no swings)**
> Rationale: RushFit already includes **dumbbell swings** (Mon/Tue) and **glute bridges**. To avoid redundancy, **no KB/dumbbell swings** here and **no hip thrust/bridges** unless you *skip* them earlier in the week.

A) **Hamstrings (primary)**: 
   - **Nordic Curl (eccentric)** 4×3–5 *or* Lying/Seated leg curl **4×8–12**
B) **Sled** push/pull **6×20–30 m** (nasal breathing pace)
C) **Carry Medley** ×3 rounds: **Suitcase carry** **20–30 m/side** → **Overhead carry** **15–25 m**
D) **Posterior Back**: **45° Back Extension** *or* **Reverse Hyper** — **3×10–15** (slow eccentrics)
E) **Groin/Adductors**: **Copenhagen plank** — **3×20–30s/side**
F) **Core (Anti‑lateral)**: Heavier **suitcase carry** **3×20–30 m/side** *(if not fatigued from C)*
G) **Mobility Finisher**: 10–15 min ankles/hips/hamstrings (ATG selections)

> **Option:** If overall fatigue is high, do only A–C + mobility.

## Squat Strategy & Anti‑Overlap
- RushFit already has **plenty of knee‑dominant work** (squats/lunges) several days per week. To avoid overuse and still build strength:
  1) Cap **heavy axial squatting** (bar on back/front) at **1×/week max**.
  2) On **Gym B**, pick **one** squat pattern based on how your AM felt:
     - **Heavy** (AM was light): **Back/Front** **4×5–6 @ RPE ~7**.
     - **Moderate** (AM had lots of squats/lunges): **Front/Goblet tempo 3‑0‑3** **3×6–8** or **2‑sec pause**.
     - **Knee‑friendly/Unilateral** (joints tired): **Bulgarian Split Squat** **3×8–10/side** + **Step‑ups** **2–3×10–12/side**; **skip axial barbell**.
  3) Keep **ATG** knee work in the morning; avoid duplicating **slant squats** at night.
  4) Aim for ~**8–12 hard knee‑dominant sets/week total** (RushFit + Gym) as a ballpark; adjust by feel.

### RushFit Knee‑Dominant Map (guideline)
| Day | RushFit block | Knee load (est.) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | Strength & Endurance | **High** | Squats/lunges frequent
| Tue | Abs/Core Conditioning | **Medium** | Lunges/squats show up
| Wed | Full‑Body Strength/Cond. | **Med‑High** | Squat pattern often present
| Thu | Fight Conditioning | **Low‑Med** | More mixed movement; less squatting
| Fri | Explosive Power | **Med‑High** | Explosive squat patterns
| Sat | Balance & Agility | **Medium** | Lunges/step patterns
| Sun | Rest | — | —

> Treat **ATG slant squats** as **light knee sets**. Count them in your weekly budget if you push them hard; otherwise keep them easy as mobility/coordination.

### Gym B Squat Decision Matrix (at a glance)
- **If AM knee load was *High*** → **No axial squat at night** → choose **Bulgarian Split Squat 3×8–10/side** *or* **Goblet Tempo 3‑0‑3 3×6–8**.
- **If AM knee load was *Medium*** → **Front/Goblet** with **tempo or pauses** **3–4×6–8**.
- **If AM knee load was *Low*** → **Heavy Axial** (**Back/Front** **4×5–6 @ RPE ~7**) — this is your **one heavy squat** for the week.

### Weekly Knee‑Dominant Budget (example)
- **RushFit contribution (est.):** ~6–10 sets/week (varies by day/intensity).
- **Gym contribution target:**
  - **Heavy week (low AM on Thu):** Gym B **4–6 sets** heavy axial.
  - **Normal week:** Gym B **3–4 sets** tempo/pause or unilateral.
  - **Deload week:** Gym B **0–2 light sets** (tempo goblet only) or **skip**.

**Downshift cues:** knee tendon ache, patellar pain, shin soreness from rope → choose **front/goblet tempo** or **unilateral**, and reduce weekly total to the **low end (8 sets)**.

## RushFit Coverage Map (from your document)
**Strength & Endurance:** includes **dumbbell swings**, squats/lunges, push‑ups, **glute bridges**, core work.  
**Abs/Core Conditioning:** again includes **dumbbell swings**, push‑ups, squats/lunges, **glute bridges**, core variations.  
**Full‑Body Strength/Conditioning:** features **power cleans**, squats, rows, presses, some hangs.  
**Fight Conditioning:** mixed movement + significant **hang/plank** volume.  
**Explosive Power Training:** includes **power clean** patterns, squats, presses.  
**Balance & Agility:** lunges, push‑ups, some **pull‑up/hang** elements.

**What’s largely *missing* in RushFit (we add at night):**  
- **Heavy bilateral hinge** (**Trap‑bar DL**)  
- **Vertical pull volume** (strict/weighted **pull‑ups**)  
- **Heavy carries** (farmer/suitcase/overhead)  
- **Anti‑rotation / anti‑lateral core** (Pallof + suitcase carry)  
- **Scapular & rotator‑cuff** (face pulls, band ER, Y‑T‑W)  
- **Grip specialization** (crush/pinch/extensor)  
- **Neck** (light isometrics)  
- **Hamstring isolation** (Nordics/leg curls) — *instead of repeating bridges/swings*

## Pull‑up & Grip Progression

- **Baseline Test:** Once at start, then every 2 weeks: strict pull‑ups max (fresh). Don’t grind.
- **Weekly Goal:** Accumulate **30–60** total strict reps via GtG + Gym A. Use band assistance to keep reps crisp.
- When you can do **8×3 strict** easily, begin **weighted**: +2.5–5 kg for **3×3** on Gym A day.
- **Grip Focus (alternate weeks):**
  - **Week A:** Crush + Support (grippers + hangs/carries)
  - **Week B:** Pinch + Extensors (plate pinch + band opens)

---

## 6‑Week Progression (Example)

**Week 1 – Base:** Pick loads giving RPE ~6–7 on prescriptions above.

**Week 2 – Build:** +2.5–5% load **or** +1 set on one main lift (not both).

**Week 3 – Consolidate:** Keep Week‑2 loads; aim for slightly lower RPE with cleaner technique.

**Week 4 – Deload:** Reduce sets by ~40–50%; keep bar speed snappy.

**Week 5 – Rebuild:** Resume Week‑3 loads with better bar speed; +1 assistance set if feeling good.

**Week 6 – Small Peak:** Add 2.5–5% on one main lift; test pull‑ups (fresh) once mid‑week.

> Repeat the 6‑week wave. Swap exercise variations if joints feel cranky (e.g., neutral‑grip pull‑ups, safety‑bar squat).

---

## Recovery & Readiness

- **RPE discipline:** Keep most work at **~7 RPE**; leave 2–3 reps in reserve.
- **Sleep:** 7–8h. **Creatine** 3–5 g/day. Hydrate + electrolytes around hard sessions.
- **Stop‑rule:** Distinct joint pain = stop/modify. Swap straight bar pulls for neutral/rings if elbows/shoulders ache.
- **Sunday Reset:** 30–60 min easy walk + long mobility. Light breathwork.

---

## Mobility & Cooldown Menu (pick 3–5 each time)

- Ankles: calf stretch, ATG ankle rocks, slant board calf raises (slow eccentrics)
- Knees: couch stretch, Patrick step‑ups (slow lower), ATG split squat holds
- Hips: pigeon, 90/90 transitions, Cossack squats (slow)
- T‑spine/Shoulders: foam roll T‑spine, wall slides, band dislocates, face pulls
- Core breath downshift: 90/90 breathing, child’s pose with long exhales

---

## Optional Neck Work (2×/week, very light)

- Isometric 4‑way (front/back/side/side) **2×20–30s**
- If using a harness: **2×15–20** ultra‑light reps; stop with any neck discomfort

---

## Equipment Checklist

- Pull‑up bar (ideally with neutral grip) or rings
- Bands (light/medium) for pull‑aparts and assistance
- Slant board / wedge (or improvised) for ATG work
- KB or DBs for swings, rows, carries
- Grippers / plates for pinch; rubber bands for extensors
- Sled or substitute (heavy belt + towel drag on turf)

### How to Customize Next
- If you upload your **RushFit breakdown**, I’ll map each gym accessory to avoid overlap and fine‑tune volumes per day.
- If elbows/shoulders complain: use **rings/neutral grip**, emphasize **scapular** work, and reduce straight‑bar volume for 2 weeks.

**Version:** 1.0 — built for your current schedule (AM RushFit + ATG, PM MA/Gym, daily GtG).
