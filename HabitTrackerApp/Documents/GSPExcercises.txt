Strength & Endurance
The main exercise portion of the Rushfit Ab Strength program, designed by Eric Owens, is a multi-round core conditioning workout that aims to fatigue you completely by targeting every muscle in your core. The core is defined broadly in this workout to include not only the abdominals but also shoulder stabilizers, glute muscles, back extensors, obliques, transverse abdominal, and rectus abdominal muscles, emphasizing the use of the whole body as one functional unit.
Here is a complete list of the exercises, including their duration, repetitions, and variations, as presented in the sources for the main workout:
    • Round 1:
        ? One-leg Squats (with one dumbbell): 
            ? Duration: 30 seconds on the left leg, then switch to the right leg for 30 seconds. 
            ? Focus: Stabilize your system using your core. 
            ? Variations: If difficult, you can tap your toe down each time. For an easier variation, keep your foot on the ground behind you. 
        ? Uppercuts (with two dumbbells): 
            ? Focus: Rotate and extend, deriving strength from the hips, not just the bicep. This motion engages obliques, legs, arms, shoulders, and lats, using the whole body as a functional unit. 
            ? Duration: Continuous, ending with a countdown (e.g., "five four three two one"). 
        ? Dumbbell Sit-ups (straight up): 
            ? Execution: Lie down with one dumbbell extended overhead with both hands, sit straight up to touch the ceiling, then lower down. Breathe out when pushing up. 
            ? Duration: 1 minute. 
            ? Variations: If challenging, perform an abdominal crunch by lifting only your shoulders off the ground. 
        ? Lying Rotations: 
            ? Execution: Slight bend in knees, palms up, rotate side to side trying to touch down, looking opposite to the direction your legs are moving. Keep legs as straight as possible with a slight bend. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 20 seconds, followed by a 10-second countdown to the next exercise. 
        ? Bicycle Crunches: 
            ? Execution: Start slow, trying to touch opposite knee to opposite elbow, engaging the entire body. 
            ? Duration: 1 minute. 
            ? Variations: If too difficult, perform a "march" where you touch your foot down between repetitions. 
    • Round 2:
        ? Dumbbell Swing: 
            ? Execution: Use primarily your legs, pushing heels down to the ground, with your arms guiding the weight. Core must activate to stabilize your body. Keep your chin in line with your belly button and look straight out, ensuring your back is arched and tight, not rounded. 
            ? Duration: 1 minute. 
        ? Dumbbell Wood Chop: 
            ? Execution: With one hand palm facing up and the other cupping it, move the dumbbell at a diagonal angle from low to high. The body maintains a good position, not collapsing, with a slight bend in the legs. Rotate on the balls of your feet. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 20 seconds, ending with a countdown (e.g., "eight 7 6 5 4 3 2 one"). 
            ? Variations: Can slightly bend arms to lighten the load, but keeping arms straight is preferred. 
        ? Dumbbell Swing (other side): 
            ? Execution: Repeat the dumbbell swing with the other hand, maintaining proper form (chin in line with belly button, looking straight out, back tight). 
            ? Duration: Timed, approximately 15-20 seconds indicated by the countdown. 
        ? Dumbbell Wood Chop (other side): 
            ? Execution: Repeat the wood chop motion at a diagonal angle on the other side. Focus on stabilizing muscles of the core to maintain posture. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 15 seconds, ending with a countdown. 
            ? Variations: If collapsing, set the weight down, take a breather, and restart. 
        ? Prone One-Arm Side Press: 
            ? Execution: From a prone position, hold the dumbbell up for 5 seconds, then lower, rotate, and press up on the other side, holding for 5 seconds. Look straight out and don't let hips sag, activate obliques. 
            ? Duration: Sequence of 5-second holds, alternating sides, implied to continue until the end of the round. 
    • Round 3 (Bodyweight):
        ? Power Sit-ups: 
            ? Execution: Explode up using momentum, driving your elbow down towards your hip. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 30 seconds. 
            ? Variations: If difficult, switch to an abdominal crunch (raising shoulders off the ground). 
        ? Right Glute Bridge: 
            ? Execution: Lie with your right leg bent and left leg straight, lift your hips up, trying to keep your thighs even or parallel. Abs, glutes, and hamstrings should be contracting. 
            ? Duration: 30 seconds. 
            ? Variations: If fatiguing, you can lower down and come back up. 
        ? Leg Raises: 
            ? Execution: Palms down, with a slight bend in the knees, raise legs up and down, tapping your heel before going back up. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 10-15 seconds per set. 
        ? Left Glute Bridge: 
            ? Execution: Repeat the glute bridge with the left leg bent and right leg straight, focusing on pushing through the heel to activate glutes and hamstrings, keeping abs contracted. 
            ? Duration: Implied similar to the right glute bridge. 
        ? V-ups: 
            ? Execution: Arms overhead, slight bend in knees, bring legs up and touch your toes. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 15 seconds. 
            ? Variations: A harder variation involves extending the toes further out. 
        ? Round 3 Repeats All Exercises: The round goes through all five exercises a second time. 
    • Round 4 (Championship Round):
        ? Opposites Drill: 
            ? Execution: From a quadruped position (hands under shoulders, knees under hips), extend an opposite leg and arm (e.g., left leg and right hand) and hold for 5 seconds. Switch sides. 
            ? Overall Duration: 2 minutes. 
            ? Variations: Can be done from a kneeling stance. A wider base provides more stability. You can hold longer than 5 seconds (10, 15, 20, 30 seconds) if it's not challenging enough. 
        ? Lateral Plank: 
            ? Execution: From a prone position, open up to one side (e.g., right), keeping hips up, and hold for 5 seconds. Rotate back down and then open to the other side. 
            ? Overall Duration: 2 minutes, alternating sides every 5 seconds. 
            ? Variations: If too easy, hold for longer (10, 15, 20, 30 seconds, or 1 minute per side). An easier variation involves forming a 90-degree angle with the body, lifting up from the hip, which still works the obliques. Ensure hips stay up and don't dip. 
        ? Straight Up (Sit-ups): 
            ? Execution: Sit straight up and down, working at your own pace. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 20 seconds, indicated by a countdown. 
            ? Variations: If your core is fatigued, perform a basic abdominal crunch (lifting shoulders without pulling on the neck). 
    • Round 5 (Most Difficult):
        ? Back Bend (Bridge): 
            ? Execution: Hands by your head, up on the balls of your feet, drive hips up high into the sky, pushing palms down and hollowing out the back. This works the entire posterior chain. 
            ? Hold Duration: 30 seconds. 
            ? Variations: If too difficult, a glute bridge is an acceptable alternative. 
        ? Sit-Through (with push-up): 
            ? Execution: Start in the Nasana position (straight legs, chest up). Lower down into a push-up, come back up, and then throw yourself forward, sitting through into the Nasana position. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 15-20 seconds per set, with instructions to get a few more reps in. 
            ? Variations: Bend knees in Nasana if needed. An easier version involves swinging the bent knee around, doing the push-up, and coming back onto the hip. You can also use a "hand boost" by pushing off your fists, but stabilize your wrists. Push-ups can be done off the knees. 
        ? Mountain Climbers: 
            ? Execution: From a prone position, keep hips even with shoulders and pump your legs, bringing knees high. 
            ? Duration: Approximately 15 seconds per set, with countdowns (e.g., "10 seconds"). 
        ? Round 5 Repeats All Exercises: The round goes through all three exercises a second time, with brief transition times.

Full-Body Strength/Conditioning

The Rushfit Full Body Strength and Conditioning workout, designed by Eric Owens, is structured into several intense rounds, excluding the warm-up and cool-down. The workout aims to flood the body with lactic acid and push through fatigue.
Here is a complete list of the exercises, including their specific parameters, for the main workout:
    • Overall Workout Structure: The program is designed to be a full-body strength and conditioning workout. It starts with a seemingly simplistic round, but it's meant to induce fatigue and lactic acid buildup, pushing participants through subsequent rounds. The goal throughout is to maintain good form and attack the exercises with intensity to achieve progress. 

Round 1: As Many Rounds As Possible (AMRAP) for 5 Minutes
    • Objective: Speed right through it, aiming for 10-15 rounds. The simplicity of the routine is part of its beauty, and when done correctly, it works every muscle in the body, causing physical changes. 
    • Exercises: 
        ? 10 Air Squats 
            ? Details: Drop down to get thighs parallel with the ground. Focus on full range of motion, extending the hip, and maintaining an upright position with good core activation. Avoid cutting the squat short. If balance or flexibility is an issue, a shallower squat is acceptable. 
        ? 5 Hindu Push-ups 
            ? Details: Go down and up quickly with full range of motion. The head should follow the body, looking up as you come up. A modification for less resistance is to perform the push-up from the knees, ensuring full range of motion is maintained. 

Round 2: Approximately 5 Minutes
    • Objective: Focus on repetitions and intensity. As fitness increases, variables like dumbbell weight can be increased to lead to progress. The exercise looks simplistic but is deceivingly difficult. 
    • Exercises (performed consecutively, then switch sides): 
        ? Dumbbell Get-up followed by One-leg One-arm Row 
            ? Details for Dumbbell Get-up: It is crucial to keep your eyes on the dumbbell at all times to prevent injury. Take your time, and if needed, catch your breath in the standing position. If you cannot comfortably come all the way up, a "half get-up" is acceptable. Following a half get-up, you can roll onto your knees to perform the row. 
            ? Details for One-leg One-arm Row: Perform three repetitions of the row. Maintain equilibrium by fixing your gaze on a non-moving point. If balance is an issue during the one-leg row after a full get-up, you can set your foot down on the ground and use your non-dumbbell arm as a brace for stability. Throughout the movement, ensure proper body position with a strong, neutral spine and activated core and abdominals. 

Round 3: Two Sets with a 30-Second Break Between Sets
    • Objective: This round increases in intensity and complexity, combining major movements to work nearly every muscle in the human body. It involves a quick transfer between exercises. 
    • Structure: Four different exercises performed for 30 seconds each, with a 5-second transfer time to the next exercise. After all four exercises are completed, there is a 30-second break before repeating the sequence for a second set. When picking up dumbbells, address them properly to avoid bending over. 
    • Exercises: 
        ? Dumbbell Piston 
            ? Details: Begin with dumbbells facing up, maintaining a strong, unrounded spine position. The body acts like a piston, moving up and down. Ensure a full squat every time. 
        ? Squat Thrust 
            ? Details: Set the dumbbells down, squat down, hop back, then squat back up. Important not to round your back. Variations include performing the exercise without dumbbells or stepping back instead of hopping. Looking up towards the ceiling can be a good trick. 
        ? Sumo High Pull 
            ? Details: Explode up and down, ensuring elbows are above the wrist and popping the hip. This wide-stance movement works the adductors, glutes, trapezius, and rear deltoids, acting as a counter-motion to the Piston. Use legs, arms, and back. 
        ? Narrow Push-up 
            ? Details: Aim to get your chest almost to the ground. If fatigue sets in, it's acceptable to lower down to your knees for a break or modification. Keep the core pulled in and everything tight. 

Round 4: Two Sets with a 30-Second Break Between Sets
    • Objective: Continue pushing through by switching muscle groups, which helps keep calories burning and metabolism working. Focus on speed and maintaining good form. 
    • Structure: Similar to Round 3, with four exercises performed for 30 seconds each, a 5-second transfer time, and a 30-second break after the full sequence before repeating. 
    • Exercises: 
        ? Alternate Backward Lunge with Stabilization 
            ? Details: Lunge backward, then stabilize at the front by holding one leg up, switching legs side to side. This adds a balance component. Variations include a stationary split squat or performing without the single-leg stabilization. 
        ? Y-Press (Alternating Arms Side to Side) 
            ? Details: Ensure the core is activated and shoulders are stable. More fit individuals can perform the press at a more upward angle. 
        ? Internal External Curl 
            ? Details: Focus on full flexion and full extension without short, choppy motions. This exercise works the muscles inside the shoulder, biceps, and forearms. Do not round your back or pull with your back; lower the weight if necessary to maintain proper form. 
        ? Cross-back Lunge with Reach 
            ? Details: Lunge side to side, reaching to the front and allowing the dumbbells to lower down. Bringing the dumbbell straight up can add more bicep work. 

Round 5: The Championship Round
    • Objective: This is the final and most intense round, designed to determine "who's going to be the champion". The goal is to finish strong by executing as many repetitions as possible with good form. 
    • Structure: The round starts with two consecutive sets of three exercises, each for 30 seconds with no rest in between. Following these two sets, all movements are combined into a final, continuous 2-minute sequence. Transfers between standing and ground positions are important. 
    • Exercises (First two rounds: 30 seconds each, no rest): 
        ? Prone Row 
            ? Details: Row side to side while keeping the core stabilized. A modification for fatigue is to perform the exercise from the knees. 
        ? Power Clean 
            ? Details: From a narrow stance, explode up and land with a soft knee position. Squatting slightly before the clean is a variation for those finding the power clean tough. A less complicated substitution is a squat with a curl. 
        ? Push Press 
            ? Details: This is essentially an overhead shoulder press using leg assistance for more lift. Maintain an active core, and avoid arching your back or leaning back too much. It's acceptable to lower the weight if you are fatiguing. 
    • Final Section (2 Minutes): 
        ? Combined Movements 
            ? Details: This section combines all the previous movements: widen your stance, squat down, hop back into the prone row position, then perform rows. Hop up, narrow your stance, execute a power clean, and finish with a push press. A variation involves stepping up, bringing the dumbbell to a good position, performing a squat, a curl, and a press, then stepping back onto the knees. This horizontal to vertical movement is challenging and effective for calorie burning and full-body activation. Focus on good explosion and quick transitions between movements. 

Fight Conditioning

The "Rushfit Fight Conditioning" program features a main workout designed as an MMA workout that transitions frequently from vertical to horizontal movements, incorporating groundwork and takedowns in addition to striking and movement. The main workout is structured into five rounds, each lasting five minutes. Calisthenics are included at the end of each round during the break.
Below is a comprehensive list of the exercises in the main workout, excluding the warm-up and cool-down:
    • Round 1: Footwork and Body Movement (5 minutes)
        ? Basic Movement: Going forward, backward, side to side. You should find your own rhythm for these basic motions. 
        ? Stance Switches: Performed throughout, often switching stance every 30 seconds. It is important to return to a natural "home base" stance after each movement. 
        ? Level Change: Exaggerating the movement to perform a deep squat if possible, to strengthen leg muscles. 
        ? Shoot Pivot: Moving forward, backward, side to side, then pivoting towards the back heel. 
        ? Sprawl: Forward backward side side sprawl. A modification allows you to put your hands down, step back, and step up instead of a full sprawl. 
        ? Circling: Moving around an imaginary opponent in the center, alternating between right lead (Orthodox) and Southpaw stances, and switching directions. 
    • Calisthenics (After Round 1, before Round 2)
        ? Squat with a Kick: Four repetitions. 
        ? Knuckle Push-ups: Four repetitions, with hands lifting off the ground. A plank is an acceptable variation if your arms are tired. 
    • Round 2: Striking (5 minutes)
        ? Jab Cross Hook Level Change: This combination is performed from a right (Orthodox) stance, then repeated after switching to a Southpaw stance. The jab is always the lead hand, cross the rear hand, and hook the lead hand. Focus on getting deep on the level changes to work leg muscles. 
        ? Uppercut Hook Rear Knee Level Change: Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances, getting deep on the level changes. 
        ? Hook Cross Hook Rear Kick Sprawl: Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. For those finding the sprawl difficult, a modification involves a rear kick, hands down, step back, and step up. 
        ? Jab Cross Hook Rear Kick Check the Leg Kick: Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. The "check the leg kick" is a defensive maneuver from Thai boxing, developing balance and stability. 
        ? Jab Roundhouse Sidekick Pivot Back: Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances, involving a rotation then throwing a sidekick. This exercise requires a lot of balance and practice. It is acceptable to adjust the height of the kicks. 
    • Calisthenics (After Round 2, before Round 3)
        ? Squat with a Kick: Four repetitions. 
        ? Knuckle Push-ups: Four repetitions, with hands lifting off the ground. A plank is an acceptable variation. 
    • Round 3: Striking to Takedowns (5 minutes)
        ? Jab Cross Level Change: Starts simple and builds in complexity. Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. 
        ? Jab Cross Shoot Pivot: Involves a level change on the "shoot" and pivoting around towards the back heel to maintain the same stance. Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. 
        ? Cross Hook Shoot Lift Slam Pivot: This combination involves a "slam" where you lower down to a squat and brace on your arms. Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. 
        ? Elbow Elbow Back Step Uchi Mata: This incorporates an Uchi Mata, which is a Judo throw, requiring balance and stability. Performed from both sides. 
        ? Uppercut Hook Sprawl: Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. A modification for the sprawl involves an uppercut hook, hands down, step back, and step up. 
    • Calisthenics (After Round 3, before Round 4)
        ? Squat with a Kick: Four repetitions. 
        ? Knuckle Push-ups: Four repetitions, with hands lifting off the ground. A plank is an acceptable variation. 
    • Round 4: Jiu-Jitsu/Groundwork (5 minutes)
        ? All exercises in this round are performed on the ground and each for 60 seconds. 
        ? Hip Escape: Moving side to side, transitioning the body from straight to a 90-degree angle by moving the hips out. 
        ? Arm Bar ABS Drill: Lying down, posting one foot, rotating while keeping shoulders off the ground, similar to holding an abdominal crunch. The head moves side to side. 
        ? Kimura Sit-up: Moving side to side, imagining locking on a Kimura (a shoulder lock) and rotating the spine. A modification is to do a crunch, bringing the wrist up and grabbing. 
        ? Triangle Choke: Bringing arms to the center, sitting up to grab, attempting to touch feet to the ceiling, then locking on a triangle grip (one foot under the other), and coming down while switching side to side. The goal is to get up on your shoulders. 
        ? Hip High Sit-up: Sitting up and performing a "Hip Heist" side to side, which involves lifting the hips up and kicking through. This movement helps prevent being held down on the ground. 
    • Calisthenics (After Round 4, before Round 5)
        ? Squat with a Kick: Four repetitions. 
        ? Push-up Position (or Plank): Four repetitions of lowering down and taking hands off the ground. 
    • Round 5: Championship Round (5 minutes)
        ? Jab Cross Step Off Kick Pivot: Stepping off after the jab cross, throwing a kick with the back leg, then pivoting around to the other side. It's important to have a clear area and pivot towards the back heel to return to your stance. 
        ? Standing Guard Pass with Two Punches: Involves putting one knee down (the leg that stood up), throwing two punches, standing up, throwing two punches, and then going back down, switching sides. The goal is to perform as many repetitions as possible. This vertical to horizontal movement is very fatiguing. 
        ? In-fighting: Elbow Elbow Knee Level Change: Focus on connecting the movements and performing a deep squat with each level change. Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. 
        ? Jab Front Kick Sprawl Knee: Similar to someone shooting in, you sprawl, come up, and throw a knee. Performed from both Orthodox and Southpaw stances. 
        ? Scramble: Working at your own pace, performing full rotations and half rotations while staying on your feet and hands, ensuring your butt doesn't touch the ground. 
    • Calisthenics (At the very end of the workout, before the cool-down)
        ? Squat with a Kick: Four repetitions. 
        ? Push-up Position (or Plank): Four repetitions of lowering down and taking hands off the ground. 
Throughout the workout, participants are advised to find their own rhythm and work at their own rate, taking pauses at the end of combinations if needed, rather than during them. Modifications are often provided to accommodate different flexibility and fatigue levels. The overall goal is to simulate a fight by combining dynamic and isometric tension, increasing metabolism, burning calories, and improving coordination.

Explosive Power Training

Here is a complete list of all the exercises included in the main "Rushfit Explosive Power Training" workout, excluding the warm-up and cool-down, drawing on the information from the sources:
This plyometric training program, designed by Eric Owens, focuses on the stretch-shortening cycle, treating muscles like a rubber band that stretches and snaps back. The exercises are designed to be explosive, incorporating lots of jumping and quick motions. The emphasis is on quality repetitions, not quantity, and often involves a brief pause between repetitions to allow for more force in each movement. The overall goal is to improve explosiveness, rather than endurance, requiring maximum intensity from start to finish.

Main Workout Exercises
General Principles:
    • Focus on quality, not quantity of repetitions. 
    • Exercises are explosive, involving quick motions and jumping. 
    • Often includes a pause between repetitions to maximize force. 
    • The workout is designed to improve explosiveness, not endurance. 
    • Maintain maximum intensity from beginning to end. 

Round 1: Low Intensity Priming This round serves as an extra warm-up beyond the initial warm-up, aiming to prime the body for subsequent rounds with lower intensity. Each exercise in this circuit is performed for 30 seconds.
    • Jumping Jacks 
        ? Instructions: Keep moving, but do not go too fast. You will feel your shoulders burning. 
    • Opening and Closing (Seals) 
        ? Instructions: Close hands in front, then open wide. Find a suitable pace. Not high jumping, just quick feet. Keep arms straight, no bent elbows. 
    • Crossovers (Arm and Leg) 
        ? Instructions: Cross over arm and leg. 
    • Front and Back (Alternating Arms) 
        ? Instructions: Similar motion to running. The intensity is relatively low, though your heart rate may increase. 
    • Ice Skaters 
        ? Instructions: Touch to the outside of the foot, moving side to side. Try to touch down each time, slowing the pace if needed. Keep toes pointing straight ahead. 
    • Jump Squat (Explosive Repetitions) 
        ? Tempo: The tempo slows down for this exercise. 
        ? Repetitions: Aim for a maximum of 8 repetitions, but 3 to 5 reps are acceptable. 
        ? Instructions: Explode more. Land, stand, and then go again. Stop and then explode for maximum explosive power. 
    • Alternate Bounding 
        ? Instructions: Mimics running, popping off the drive leg with the knee and counter arm coming up. Focus on explosiveness and reaching up to the sky. 
    • Ice Skaters (Repeat) 
        ? Instructions: Reaching to the outside of the foot. This movement is low intensity but can cause fatigue and lactic acid accumulation. 
    • Jump Squats (Repeat) 
        ? Repetitions: Max 8 repetitions within the 30-second interval. 
        ? Instructions: Land, then drive again. Stop and explode. 
    • Alternate Bounding (Repeat) 
        ? Instructions: Allows for a few more reps, but still not rushed. Explode up, reaching for the sky to prepare the body for the coming intensity. 

Round 2: Plyo Version of Strength & Endurance Workout This round is a plyometric version of a strength and endurance workout, emphasizing less repetitions and more explosion. The rep cap is around 5 repetitions, or even 3 for highly explosive individuals, allowing time to explode, relax, and recharge.
    • Jump Squats 
        ? Instructions: Land, stand, reset, and go. Put everything you have into each repetition. The pauses in between are intentional. (Later noted as "not a tuck jump, just a jump squat"). 
    • Squat Thrust with Tuck Jump 
        ? Instructions: Land, relax, recharge, and go. Jump high with every repetition. 
    • Plyo Push-up 
        ? Instructions: Explode up from the push-up position. 
    • Plyo Pop-up (from Prone Position) 
        ? Instructions: Lie belly down, then pop up. 
    • Plyo Burpee (Combination) 
        ? Instructions: Starts with a jump back. (Later described as starting with a jump squat, then coming down, and performing a tuck jump, ensuring chest goes to the ground). 
    • Combined Movement (Final Exercise of Round 2) 
        ? Instructions: A combination of a jump squat, going down, touching the chest, and then a tuck jump. This emphasizes vertical to horizontal explosion. 

Round 3: With Light Dumbbells This round incorporates light dumbbells (e.g., 5-10 lbs). The focus remains on the quality of repetitions, not the quantity.
    • Punch Press 
        ? Repetitions: Aim for 5 repetitions. 
        ? Instructions: Perform while bouncing. Pop the hip and ensure full rotation. 
    • Jump Squat (with dumbbells) 
        ? Repetitions: Perform 5 repetitions. 
        ? Instructions: Hold the dumbbells. Explode up, shrugging as you come up. If the weight is too heavy, it's acceptable to drop the dumbbells. 
    • Low Shuffle 
        ? Repetitions/Duration: First sets: 10 repetitions, alternating arms. Second set: slow down, "stick it". Last set: 30 seconds for time, moving fast with speed, trying to stay low. 
        ? Instructions: Try to keep the thigh parallel to the ground. If fatigued, it's okay to raise up. 

Round 4: Heavier Dumbbells & Bounding This round utilizes heavier dumbbells (e.g., 20-30 lbs). You can decrease weight if needed. The key is to perform 5 repetitions or less for maximum explosion per rep, rather than maximum reps per set.
    • Dumbbell Power Clean 
        ? Repetitions: Only 5 repetitions. 
        ? Instructions: Fold over, explode, clean the dumbbells, stand, then lower the weights. Feet can leave the ground or stay. The pull should come from the legs, not the arms. Focus on getting the chest over the legs when starting. 
    • Push Press 
        ? Repetitions: Perform 5 repetitions. 
        ? Instructions: Keep dumbbells up top. Dip and explode. Look down as you press up to clear space in the scapula for better extension. 
    • Forward Bounding (Two Legs) 
        ? Instructions: Jump in one direction, covering distance, then rotate. Stick the landing. 
        ? Duration: The last set is 20 seconds. 

Round 5: Combination & New Exercises This round combines the first two motions from Round 4 and introduces new exercises.
    • Power Clean & Push Press (Combined) 
        ? Repetitions: Perform 5 repetitions. 
        ? Instructions: You can pause at the top after the clean before hitting the push press, or perform it all together. Work at your own tempo. When instructed, perform the entire combined motion. Remember to squat down to place the dumbbells on the mat, don't just bend over. Focus on getting more over the weights and extending the hip. It's natural to let out air during the movement. 
    • Fencer's Lunge 
        ? Repetitions: Perform 10 repetitions. 
        ? Instructions: Turn to face the other way with each lunge. This is good for "blitzing" and takedowns in fighting. Move across the mat, not just up. 
    • Lateral Bounding 
        ? Repetitions: Perform 10 repetitions. 
        ? Instructions: Focus on covering height and distance, moving side to side. Stabilize on one leg. You can kick the trailing leg behind or touch it down. Work at your own pace. 
        ? Duration: The last set is for 10 repetitions with a focus on more explosion and distance. 


Balance & Agility
The main exercise program in the Rushfit Balance workout, designed by Eric Owens, is a bodyweight circuit focused on balance and agility, without requiring any weights. The workout involves many stabilization exercises performed on one leg, with modifications available if you find it challenging, such as using a balance leg or limiting your range of motion. The emphasis is on maintaining good form and working at your own pace rather than achieving a specific number of repetitions or perfect form.
Below is a complete list of the exercises, including their time intervals and rounds, as presented in the sources:
Workout Structure and Exercises:
The workout begins immediately after the warm-up, moving into a series of functional movements. The entire workout is described as a circuit.
    • Four-Way Lunge
        ? Description: Starts with feet together. Rotate towards the right and lunge with the left leg, touching down with the right hand. Then move to the opposite side, always returning to the center. The goal is to settle down into your heel, avoiding the knee going too far past the toes. 
        ? Time Interval: Approximately 60 seconds (inferred from the "about five seconds left" cue before switching, similar to the warm-up's 60-second intervals). 
    • Lateral Lunge
        ? Description: With feet together, lunge side to side. Imagine your feet are running on parallel lines, and keep your toes pointing straight ahead, not out or in. 
        ? Time Interval: Approximately 60 seconds (inferred from the "about five more seconds" cue before switching). This exercise works much of the inside of the leg and all leg muscles. 
    • Backwards Lunge
        ? Description: Step back and touch down with the same hand as the leg that steps back. The knee should almost touch the ground, but it's important not to hurt your knees, especially on hard floors. 
        ? Time Interval: Not explicitly stated, but part of a continuous flow, likely for 60 seconds. 
    • Crossback Lunge
        ? Description: Stand up fully, then step behind and touch down with the same hand as the foot that is leading. 
        ? Time Interval: Not explicitly stated, but part of a continuous flow, likely for 60 seconds. 
    • Driver (with a dumbbell as a marker)
        ? Description: Start by balancing on one leg (e.g., right leg), keeping the other leg (left leg) off the ground. Reach down with the opposite hand (left hand) to touch a dumbbell marker. Then switch sides, balancing on the left leg and reaching with the right hand. Bending the leg slightly as you go down is part squat, part bend at the waist. The further the distance to the dumbbell, the more difficult it is. Focus your gaze on your target to maintain balance. 
        ? Time Interval: 60 seconds total, performed for approximately 30 seconds per side (implied by the "10 more seconds" cue for the first side before switching). This exercise challenges balance and works all leg muscles, promoting healthy knees and ankles, and engaging the core. 
    • Rotation (Dumbbell rotation on one leg)
        ? Description: Step over to one side (e.g., left), balancing on the opposite foot (right foot). Reach across with the hand on the same side as the step (left hand) and bring your body up straight. If you lose balance, you can briefly touch down and regain your stance. This exercise is more difficult on smooth surfaces and is best done barefoot. 
        ? Time Interval: Not explicitly stated, but follows the Driver exercise, likely performed for approximately 60 seconds total (30 seconds per side), targeting muscles underneath the foot, ankle, and knees. These stabilizing muscles are often "asleep" in modern life. 
    • Single-Leg Reach Variations (with dumbbell as a marker)
        ? Description: While balancing on one leg (e.g., right leg), reach across with the same-side hand (right hand) to touch the dumbbell and pull back up. Then switch to the other leg (left leg) and reach across with the left hand. Shorten your range of motion if you find yourself collapsing. 
        ? Time Interval: Approximately 60 seconds total (implied by "about five more seconds" cue for the first side). This exercise can cause a burning sensation in different areas for different people, such as the foot or hips. 
    • Airplane (One-Leg Twist)
        ? Description: Balance on one leg (e.g., right leg), extend arms out wide, and twist your body side to side. Activate your core muscles and take your time with the rotation. Then switch to the left leg and repeat. 
        ? Time Interval: Approximately 60 seconds total (inferred by "That's time" for the first side and "five more seconds" for the second side), indicating roughly 30 seconds per side. This exercise helps bring balance back into the body. 
    • X-Jump
        ? Description: A jumping pattern where you jump in, out, in, out, moving back and forth in an X pattern. You don't have to go too quickly, but can increase speed if it's not challenging enough. 
        ? Time Interval: 30 seconds. 
        ? Rounds: Performed as part of a circuit and then repeated once after the Line Jump, making it two rounds of X-Jumps within this specific sequence. 
    • Line Jump
        ? Description: Quick feet, moving side to side, then forward a few feet, then back. Keep a soft bend in the knees to absorb impact and protect joints. This involves quickly changing direction, a key component in fighting and other activities. 
        ? Time Interval: 30 seconds (implied by the "10 more seconds" cue for the first set, and the pattern with X-jump). 
        ? Rounds: Performed as part of a circuit and then repeated once after the second X-Jump, making it two rounds of Line Jumps within this specific sequence. 
Second Circuit (Repeated Twice):
The following group of exercises constitutes a circuit that is performed twice.
    • Gorilla Squat
        ? Description: Come down with fists onto the ground, brace your hands, shift weight forward, hop up your feet, and stand. The goal is to land with thighs parallel to the ground like a full squat. Move two steps in one direction, then turn and go two steps in the other. 
        ? Time Interval: 60 seconds per round. 
        ? Rounds: Two rounds total. The first round is 60 seconds. The second round, performed immediately after the first full circuit, is approximately 30 seconds. 
    • Mule Kick / Frog / Bullfrog Drill
        ? Description: Come down onto your hands, brace your weight, rock weight forward, and kick both legs up simultaneously before standing up. If uncomfortable kicking up, you can just lift your legs off the ground. It's important to keep your core tight. 
        ? Time Interval: 60 seconds per round ("one minute"). 
        ? Rounds: Two rounds total. The first round is 60 seconds. The second round is approximately 30 seconds. 
    • Alligator Crawl / Bear Crawl
        ? Description: Keep your body low, just above the mat, with your elbow right next to your knee. Move two steps forward and two steps back. The lower your hips are to the ground, the more difficult it is, as it increases core activation. 
        ? Time Interval: 60 seconds per round ("one minute of this"). 
        ? Rounds: Two rounds total. The first round is 60 seconds. The second round is approximately 30 seconds. 
    • Floor Pull-up with a Popup
        ? Description: Start in a prone position with arms extended in front. Pull yourself forward by arching your back and pulling your elbows towards your hips, then place your hands by your side and pop up to a standing position. Turn around, lie down, and repeat in the other direction. Keeping your butt off the ground and raising your body onto your forearms uses your lat muscles and spinal erectors. 
        ? Time Interval: Approximately 60 seconds per round (inferred from the "30 more seconds" cue suggesting completion of a full minute). 
        ? Rounds: Two rounds total. The first round is approximately 60 seconds. The second round is approximately 30 seconds. 
    • Walking Lateral Push-up
        ? Description: Move side to side. As you cross one hand over, touch your feet together, then spread your feet out as you move the other hand. You can perform a full push-up, a knee push-up, or just lower down if you are too tired. The key is the motion of crossing over and under with the hands. Keep your hips down low, even with your shoulders, to activate your core. 
        ? Time Interval: 60 seconds per round ("one minute of this"). 
        ? Rounds: Two rounds total. The first round is 60 seconds. The second round is approximately 25 seconds. 
The workout concludes after the second round of the Walking Lateral Push-up. The instructors emphasize that even without resistance, using your body correctly provides an effective workout. They also note that it's normal not to achieve perfect form or complete every repetition, as the goal is to push to your full potential while staying safe.
