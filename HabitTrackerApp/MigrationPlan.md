# MAUI Migration Plan for Habit Tracker

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for transitioning the existing MVC-based Habit Tracker application to a cross-platform MAUI solution that works on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.

## Architecture

The solution has been restructured using a layered architecture:

1. **Core Layer**
   - Domain Models
   - Interfaces for Repository Pattern
   - Business Logic Services
   - Platform-independent code

2. **Data Access Layer**
   - Entity Framework implementation for Web/Desktop
   - SQLite implementation for Mobile (planned)
   - Repository Pattern implementations

3. **UI Layers**
   - MVC for Web (existing)
   - MAUI for cross-platform (planned)

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Core Restructuring (Completed)
- ✅ Create Core folders for Models, Interfaces, Services, and Data
- ✅ Extract domain models to Core.Models namespace
- ✅ Define repository interfaces
- ✅ Implement service layer with business logic
- ✅ Create EF-based repositories that implement the interfaces
- ✅ Update Program.cs with dependency injection for new services

### Phase 2: MAUI Project Setup (In Progress)
- Create MAUI project structure
- Link Core project for shared code
- Implement MAUI-specific data access (SQLite for offline functionality)
- Design UI components for mobile

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation (Planned)
- User authentication and profile management
- Habit tracking views (day view, week view)
- Stats and visualizations
- Notifications and reminders
- Cloud synchronization

### Phase 4: Deployment & Testing (Planned)
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Platform-specific testing for iOS, Android, and desktop
- App store publishing

## Technical Details

### Data Persistence Strategy
- Web: SQL Server via Entity Framework
- Mobile: SQLite for local storage
- Cloud synchronization with API endpoints

### UI Architecture
- MVVM pattern for MAUI
- Shared ViewModels with platform-specific Views
- Dependency Injection for services

## Next Steps

1. Set up the MAUI project using .NET MAUI workload
2. Create platform-specific projects (Android, iOS, Windows)
3. Implement basic UI screens
4. Implement SQLite data access
5. Add authentication and synchronization
