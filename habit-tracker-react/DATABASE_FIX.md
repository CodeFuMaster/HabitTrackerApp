# Database Fix - October 5, 2025

## Problem
The MVC app was throwing `SQLite Error 1: 'no such table: Habits'` when trying to access the database.

## Root Cause
- The `habittracker.db` database file existed but had no tables
- Previous migrations were designed for PostgreSQL but we switched to SQLite
- The existing migrations had "pending model changes" that prevented them from being applied

## Solution
1. Created a new migration specifically for SQLite:
   ```powershell
   dotnet ef migrations add SqliteMigration --context AppDbContext
   ```

2. Applied all migrations to create the database schema:
   ```powershell
   dotnet ef database update --context AppDbContext
   ```

## Result
All required tables were created successfully:
- ✅ Categories
- ✅ Goals  
- ✅ Habits
- ✅ DailyHabitEntries
- ✅ HabitMetricDefinitions
- ✅ DailyMetricValues

## Database Details
- **Database Type**: SQLite
- **Database File**: `habittracker.db` (in HabitTrackerApp folder)
- **DbContext**: `AppDbContext` (used by MVC controllers)
- **Migrations Applied**:
  - 20250528154046_InitialPostgres
  - 20250705192943_InitialCreate
  - 20251005104146_SqliteMigration (NEW)

## MVC App Status
The MVC app should now be running without database errors. You can access it at the URL shown in the PowerShell terminal window (typically http://localhost:5XXX).

## Important Notes
- The database is now empty (no habits or data)
- Both `AppDbContext` and `HabitTrackerDbContext` point to the same `habittracker.db` file
- Sync functionality with the API still doesn't work (separate issue documented in SYNC_NOT_WORKING.md)
- The React app uses a separate SQLite database in the browser (via sql.js)
