# ⚠️ Sync Feature Status

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: NOT WORKING - App Works Offline Only

---

## 🔴 Current Issue

The sync feature between React app and API server is **not working** due to database initialization problems.

### **Error**: 
```
SQLite Error 1: 'no such table: Habits'
```

The API server database hasn't been properly initialized with tables.

---

## ✅ What DOES Work

### **Offline Mode (Fully Functional)**
- ✅ Web app: http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Desktop app (Electron)
- ✅ Mobile app (Capacitor/Android)
- ✅ All habit tracking features
- ✅ Local SQLite database in browser
- ✅ Add habits, complete habits, view statistics
- ✅ All features work without API

**The app is designed to work offline-first**, so you can use it completely without the API server!

---

## ❌ What DOESN'T Work

### **Synchronization**
- ❌ API Server: http://localhost:5178 (crashes on startup)
- ❌ Cross-device sync
- ❌ PostgreSQL database
- ❌ Push/pull changes between devices

---

## 🎯 How to Use the App (Offline Only)

### **Web Browser**:
```
Open: http://localhost:5173
```

### **Desktop (Electron)**:
- Window should be open already
- All data stored locally in app folder

### **Mobile (Android)**:
- Open Android Studio
- Click green "Run" button
- All data stored locally on device

**Each platform has its own independent database!**

---

## 📊 Data Storage

```
Web Browser:    IndexedDB (browser storage)
Desktop App:    SQLite file (app folder)
Mobile App:     SQLite file (app storage)
```

**No sync = Each device is independent**

---

## 🔧 To Fix Sync (Future)

The API server needs:
1. Database initialization
2. Migration to create tables
3. Proper startup configuration
4. PostgreSQL or SQLite properly configured

But for now, **the app works perfectly without it!**

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Use the app in offline mode!** It has all features:
- ✅ Create habits
- ✅ Track daily completions  
- ✅ View statistics and charts
- ✅ Set reminders
- ✅ Week view
- ✅ Categories
- ✅ Streaks and heatmaps

The only missing feature is syncing data between multiple devices.
