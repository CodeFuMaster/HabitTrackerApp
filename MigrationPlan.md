# MAUI Migration Plan for Habit Tracker

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for transitioning the existing MVC-based Habit Tracker application to a cross-platform MAUI solution that works on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.

## Architecture

The solution has been restructured using a layered architecture:

1. **Core Layer**
   - Domain Models
   - Interfaces for Repository Pattern
   - Business Logic Services
   - Platform-independent code

2. **Data Access Layer**
   - Entity Framework implementation for Web/Desktop
   - SQLite implementation for Mobile (planned)
   - Repository Pattern implementations

3. **UI Layers**
   - MVC for Web (existing)
   - MAUI for cross-platform (planned)

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Core Restructuring (Completed)
- ✅ Create Core folders for Models, Interfaces, Services, and Data
- ✅ Extract domain models to Core.Models namespace
- ✅ Define repository interfaces
- ✅ Implement service layer with business logic
- ✅ Create EF-based repositories that implement the interfaces
- ✅ Update Program.cs with dependency injection for new services

### Phase 2: MAUI Project Setup (Planned)
- Create MAUI project structure
- Link Core project for shared code
- Implement MAUI-specific data access (SQLite for offline functionality)
- Design UI components for mobile
- Establish state management pattern
- Set up error handling and logging framework
- Configure localization resources

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation (Planned)
- User authentication and authorization system
- Habit tracking views (day view, week view)
- Stats and visualizations
- Notifications and reminders
- Cloud synchronization with offline capabilities
- Accessibility implementations
- Internationalization support

### Phase 4: Deployment & Testing (Planned)
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Platform-specific testing for iOS, Android, and desktop
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Security auditing
- App store publishing

## Technical Details

### Authentication & Authorization
- Identity provider integration (Microsoft Identity, Auth0, etc.)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure token management
- Biometric authentication support where available
- Device trust verification

### State Management Strategy
- MVVM pattern with ObservableObject
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for property change notifications
- State containers for complex UI states
- Predictable unidirectional data flow
- Caching strategy for performance optimization

### Data Persistence Strategy
- Web: SQL Server via Entity Framework
- Mobile: SQLite for local storage
- Cloud synchronization with API endpoints
- Versioned data schemas for migrations
- Data encryption for sensitive information

### UI Architecture
- MVVM pattern for MAUI
- Shared ViewModels with platform-specific Views
- Dependency Injection for services
- Custom controls for consistent UX
- Responsive layouts for different form factors

### Error Handling and Logging
- Centralized exception handling
- Structured logging using Serilog
- Crash analytics integration (App Center, Firebase)
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic error reporting
- Detailed logging for debugging and analytics

### Offline Synchronization
- Queue-based synchronization for reliability
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Background sync with configurable intervals
- Network connectivity monitoring
- Optimistic UI updates with server verification

### Push Notifications
- Platform-specific notification implementations
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android
- Apple Push Notification Service for iOS
- Windows Notification Service
- Notification categories and actions
- Schedule-based local notifications

### Internationalization (Localization)
- Resource-based string management
- Right-to-left (RTL) language support
- Culture-specific formatting (dates, numbers, currencies)
- Image and asset localization where needed
- Language selection UI

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as minimum standard
- Semantic markup for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast requirements (4.5:1 minimum)
- Dynamic text sizing
- Voice-over and TalkBack testing
- Platform-specific accessibility testing

### Performance
- Performance profiling for each platform
- Cold start optimization (<2 seconds target)
- Memory usage optimizations (<100MB target)
- Database query performance tuning
- Asset optimization (size, loading)
- Battery usage monitoring
- Network request batching and optimization

## Next Steps

1. Set up the MAUI project using .NET MAUI workload
2. Create platform-specific projects (Android, iOS, Windows)
3. Implement basic UI screens with accessibility considerations
4. Implement SQLite data access with offline sync capabilities
5. Add authentication and authorization system
6. Configure logging and error handling
7. Setup localization resources
8. Implement performance monitoring
