- ✅ Accurate week completion percentage
- ✅ Best day calculation (day with most completions)
- ✅ Click checkboxes to toggle completion
- ✅ Instant UI updates with optimistic rendering

### 3. **Improved Initialization** 🚀
- ✅ Graceful handling of offline mode
- ✅ Non-blocking data loading
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Works even if server is unavailable

## 🎯 Testing the Week View

### Open the App:
1. Go to http://localhost:5174/
2. Click the **"Week"** tab

### Try These Features:
1. **View Real Data**:
   - See your "GSP Training" habit
   - See actual completion status for each day
   
2. **Toggle Completion**:
   - Click any checkbox (○ or ✓)
   - Watch it update immediately
   - Data is saved to local database
   - Will sync to server when online

3. **Navigate Weeks**:
   - Click **<** to go to previous week
   - Click **>** to go to next week
   - Click **Today** button to jump back to current week

4. **View Statistics**:
   - See completion percentage for the week
   - See current streak (consecutive days completed)
   - See best day of the week

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you see "Failed to Initialize":

**Check MVC Server:**
```powershell
# Test if server is running
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:5178/api/HabitApi/ping

# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

**Check API Connection:**
```powershell
# Test if API returns habits
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:5178/api/HabitApi

# Should return array of habits with your "GSP Training" habit
```

**If Server Not Running:**
```powershell
cd C:\Repo\HabitTrackerApp\HabitTrackerApp\HabitTrackerApp
dotnet run
```

### Browser Console Logs:

Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab to see:
- "Initializing app..."
- "Loaded X habits from server"
- "Loaded X categories from server"
- "Initial data loaded successfully"

If you see errors, they'll show here.

## 🎨 How It Works

### Data Flow:
```
1. User clicks checkbox in Week View
        ↓
2. useToggleHabitCompletion() hook called
        ↓
3. syncService.toggleHabitCompletion()
        ↓
4. offlineDb.saveDailyEntry() - saves to SQLite
        ↓
5. React Query invalidates cache
        ↓
6. UI re-renders with new data
        ↓
7. syncService auto-syncs to server (30s interval)
```

### Streak Calculation:
```typescript
// Counts backwards from today
// Stops when hits first non-completed day
// Example: ✓✓✓○✓✓ = 3 day streak (not 5)
```

### Week Statistics:
- **Completion %**: (completed slots) / (total slots) × 100
- **Best Day**: Day with most habit completions
- **Streak**: Consecutive days from today backwards
